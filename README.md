# FCE_bot
Before starting the bot, you will also have to install all the modules for python so "pip install -r requirements.txt".

To start the bot create also two file in that directory and call it "fcebot_token.txt" and "news_fcebot_token.txt", there you will write your bots tokens. The first one is for the "real" bot, the second one is for the "news", it sends news into the channel.

To start use scheduler.sh
